Context
You specify a password for the SYSTEM user when your create your SAP HANA tenant database. You use the SYSTEM user to log on to SAP HANA cockpit and create your own database administration user.

The SYSTEM user is a preconfigured database superuser with irrevocable system privileges, such as the ability to create other database users, access system tables, and so on. A database-specific SYSTEM user exists in every database of a tenant database system. To ensure that the administration tool SAP HANA cockpit can be used immediately after database creation, the SYSTEM user is automatically given several roles the first time the SAP HANA cockpit is opened with this user.

To view the details of a database, for example, its state and the number of existing bindings, select a database in the list and click the link on its name. On the overview of the database, you can perform further actions, for example, delete the database.

This is the message we get. 

You've been assigned the roles 'sap.hana.admin.roles::Administrator', 'sap.hana.ide.roles::TraceViewer', 'sap.hana.ide.roles::SecurityAdmin'.
